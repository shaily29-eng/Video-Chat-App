## Introduction
The React Video Chat App is a web application that allows users to have real-time video and audio conversations with each other. It was built using WebRTC technology, which enables browser-to-browser communication without the need for any additional plugins or software. The app is essentially a Zoom clone that uses WebRTC to establish peer-to-peer connections between users.

## Here are the key features of the project:
React Framework: The front-end of the application was developed using the React framework, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a modular and scalable approach to building UI components, which makes it ideal for this type of project.
WebRTC: The app uses WebRTC technology to establish a peer-to-peer connection between users. WebRTC is a free, open-source project that enables real-time communication between browsers. It allows for video and audio streaming, as well as data transfer, all in real-time.
Tabnine: The Tabnine tool was used in the project to provide auto-completion and code suggestions. This saved development time and ensured that code was written quickly and accurately.
Socket.io: Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It was used to handle the signaling process for establishing the WebRTC connection between users.
Material UI: Material UI is a popular React UI framework that provides pre-built components for creating modern, responsive user interfaces. It was used in this project to create the user interface components, such as buttons and forms.
Firebase: Firebase is a popular backend-as-a-service platform that provides tools for building mobile and web applications. In this project, Firebase was used to store user data, including chat messages and video calls.

Overall, the React Video Chat App project is a successful implementation of WebRTC technology in a real-world scenario. It provides a scalable and modular approach to building a video chat application using modern web development tools and techniques.


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
